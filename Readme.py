Make an open source pigbank logic SW, and replacable HW for it.
It can count the money, and show the amount of money in various ways of HW implementations.
It can show the amount/number of pieces of each type of coin,
and separate them if wanted (this can also be done in a way that it can be added later as a HW module if you whished for it).

Make a very basic version of this, that can also be sold as a DIY kit.
If someone wanted, there can be even tutorials about how to make it, explaining how to use i.e. copilot to program the microcontroller,
and/or sold also without the HW kit, making it a tutorial also about how to use gen AI to build these stuff from zero, selecting HW parts and all.

What if almost anyone could just hack stuff together, and make it work?
What and how many things could be built by any of us, for all of us?
There are so many great minds out there, and so many great ideas (maybe not the pigbank lol), but not enough time to build them.
That's what current AI models can help you out with.(/, and also make you familiarize yourself with it during the process, so you can even have a much better idea about where we stand with this thech right now.)
